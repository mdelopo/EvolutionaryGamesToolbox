# Evolutionary Games Toolbox

**EvolutionaryGamesToolbox** is a `MATLAB` toolbox designed for simulating, analyzing, and visualizing *evolutionary game dynamics*. It provides a flexible framework for defining custom strategies and tournaments and exploring their behavior through Fitness and Imitation Dynamics.

Whether you're a researcher, educator, or student, this toolbox helps you quickly prototype and study multi-strategy evolutionary games.

## What It Does

- Theoretical Analysis and Simulation of Evolutionary Dynamics in Iterated Normal-Form Symmetric games.
- Visualizing results in ways that help draw conclusions.
- Easily extendable for custom strategies, tournament setups, and game setups.

## Getting Started

To begin using the toolbox:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mdelopo/EvolutionaryGamesToolbox.git
    cd EvolutionaryGamesToolbox
    ```

2. **Run the setup script in `MATLAB`:**
    ```matlab
    setup
    ```

3. **Run example scripts:**
    ```
    All example scripts contained in the `Examples` folder can be run immediately. Each script includes comments and setup instructions to help you understand and adapt them to your needs.
    ```
## Documentation and Report

### Documentation

The repository includes a comprehensive documentation file that outlines the structure and functionality of the toolbox. This document serves as a reference for:

- Detailed descriptions of key functions
- Detailed descriptions of strategies and examples

We strongly encourage you to study the documentation and define custom strategies and games.
You can find the documentation here [`Documentation/Documentation.pdf`](Documentation/Documentation.pdf).

### Report

A detailed report is also included in the repository, which summarizes our **results, observations, and conclusions** based on the examples created using the toolbox. The report contains:

- An overview of the problem
- Comprehensive description of the key functions
- Comparative analysis of tournament setups
- Visualizations that illustrate the evolutionary dynamics
- Key insights and takeaways from our findings

This report is ideal for users who want to understand the practical applications and experimental outcomes of the toolbox. You can find it here [`Report/Report.pdf`](Report/Report.pdf).
